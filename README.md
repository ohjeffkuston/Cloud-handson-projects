# Cloud Zero to AWS Hero (my next goal)
In April 2022, I began my **FIRST** cloud role as a **Cloud Network Engineer** _(AWS-focused)_. I had **_zero cloud certs_** and **_no previous cloud experience_**. Check out [my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@giftedlane) to see how I pulled that off. Five months later, I became a **Cloud Associate Architect**. This repo is my cloud diary. It documents what I am learning along the way and how.

> This repo serves as **_my_** North Star to stay on track and move with purpose in **_my_** Cloud Journey. How **I learn and move** _may not best suit **you**_. Nevertheless, here's a look into how I operate. Enjoy! 🤗

This roadmap shows you what's to come for this repo. It will document my journey in chronological order. The roadmap is a work in progress. Only some things are present. For example, there's DevOps after the Linux milestone. So keep checking back for updates.
